## Task List

The following task list is divided into Requirements and Desirables. The intent is to focus on the Requirements and then the tasks under Desirables if time-permitting. Otherwise, these tasks would be left as additional ideas for improvement. Furthermore, since I am the only person in my team, I will be responsible for all of the tasks listed under. 

# Requirements
1. Curate a list of the top music reccommendation algorithms that currently exist. 
2. Research and analyze these algorithms for their performance and user satisfaction. 
3. Determine what works best in each of the algorithms (and if) any ideas can be reutilized for this project.
4. Determine which parameters are most relevant for defining user preferences in music. 
5. For each parameter shortlisted, find the best way to measure similarity.
6. Determine the weightage for each parameter's measure of similarity and how to calculate the cumulative similarity. 
7. Determine what framework will be most suitable for developing the android application component.
8. Design the logo and determine the color scheme for the application.
8. Design the User Interface.
9. Develop the registration/sign-up and sign-in features.
10. Develop support for editing user profile and settings.
11. Develop the playlist generator feature. 
12. Develop support to enable personalization of the recommendation algorithm. 
13. Develop support to modify search.
14. Develop a feature to export the playlists generated to Spotify.
15. Develop a feature to manage and edit the playlist after it is generated. 
16. Develop test cases to test the different components of the application. 
17. Refine the algorithm based on the results of these tests.
18. Fix any glitches, bugs or issues in the Android applicaiton.  
19. Validate all components by running the same test cases again.
20. Document all relevant information throughout the course of this project.

# Desirables
1. Develop a feature to export the playlist generated to Apple Music.
2. Determine if this project can be extended to music in different languages and the implementation of such a feature if possible.
3. Extend the registration feature to allow users to sign in using Google/Facebook.
4. Determine if the project can be extended to other forms of entertainment - movies, TV-series, podcasts, etc.
5. Develop support for importing data from user's Spotify/Apple Music profiles.
