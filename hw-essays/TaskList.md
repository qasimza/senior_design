## Task List

The following task list is divided into Requirements and Desirables. The intent is to focus on the Requirements and then the tasks under Desirables if time permits. Otherwise, these tasks would be left as additional ideas for improvement. Furthermore, since I am the only person on my team, I will be responsible for all the tasks listed below.

# Requirements
1. Curate a list of the top music recommendation algorithms that currently exist.
2. Research and analyze these algorithms for their performance and user satisfaction.
3. Determine what works best in each of the algorithms (and if) any ideas can be reutilized for this project.
4. Determine which parameters are most relevant for defining user preferences in music.
5. For each parameter shortlisted, find the best way to measure similarity.
6. Determine the weightage for each parameter's similarity measure and how to calculate the cumulative similarity.
7. Determine what framework will be most suitable for developing the android application component.
8. Design the logo and determine the color scheme for the application.
8. Design the User Interface.
9. Develop the registration/sign-up and sign-in features.
10. Develop support for editing user profiles and settings.
11. Develop the playlist generator feature.
12. Develop support to enable the personalization of the recommendation algorithm.
13. Develop support to modify the search.
14. Develop a feature to export the playlists generated to Spotify.
15. Develop a feature to manage and edit the playlist after it is generated.
16. Develop test cases to test the different components of the application.
17. Refine the algorithm based on the results of these tests and fix any glitches, bugs or issues in the Android application. Â 
18. Validate all components by rerunning the same test cases.
19. Document all relevant information throughout the course of this project.

# Desirables
1. Develop a feature to export the playlist generated to other music apps such as Apple Music.
2. Determine if this project can be extended to music in different languages and the implementation of such a feature if possible.
3. Extend the registration feature to allow users to sign in using Google/Facebook.
4. Determine if the project can be extended to other forms of entertainment - movies, TV series, podcasts, etc.
5. Develop support for importing data from users' Spotify/Apple Music profiles.
6. Develop support for playing music from within the application.
