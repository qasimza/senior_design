## Meeting Expectations
- Spend a minimum of 7 hrs./week on the Senior Design Project.
- Since this is a one-person team, aim to meet with advisor at least once every week with updates on the project as well as any questions that require an in-person discussion. 

## Project Focus and Role

Since this is a one-person team, I will be taking on multiple roles depending on the phase of the project. The project has 3 focus areas - 

1.	Data Science/Analytics: This involves substantial research and analysis of existing music recommendation algorithms, analysis of these algorithms to evaluate what existing framework can be utilized for this project, improving previously developed code as well as writing new code for the new recommendation mechanism, development of test cases, and further correction of the code based on test results. 

2.	Android/Web App Development:  This involves the creation and development of the multiple layers of the application, development of the features to support user profile creation, looking up and selecting songs, creating playlists, and storing any data that might be useful for the application.

3.	Project Management and Organization: This includes the creation of the project timeline, identifying project milestones, project documentation, and communication with the project advisor. 

* Note: Both (1) and (2) require testing and re-working the code for improvements until desired results are achieved. The desired results for the data science component include an accuracy threshold (which may be based on user satisfaction and other metrics), and an acceptable runtime and space complexity. The desired result for the Android/Web App is a fully functional application that can register a user, allow them to select songs and create a playlist based on their preferences for similarity measures when it comes to music. For this project, (1) will be prioritized over (2).*
