## Week 3 - Individual Capstone Assessment

# Project Introduction

Currently, the two most popular apps for listening music (and finding reccomendations) are Apple Music and Spotify. 
Apple Music recommends music   music recommendation algorithms for popular apps such as Spotify and Apple Music are based on "user preferences" such as the genre and artists they like or the taste in music of others who've liked the same song. Oftentimes, these reccomendations consist of songs that may not necessarily sound similar. This project will analyze music for similarity using a variety of other metrics to find songs that are similar in how they sound to make recommendations. These metrics may include:
 - Analysis of the music based on rhythm, melody and instrumentation
 - Analysis of lyrics to determine if the songs convey similar emotions or talk on the same subjects
 - Analysis of genre, artist, era in which it was released, popularity, etc. 
 Please note that the above list of metrics is neither exhaustive nor unmutable. 
 There may-be a user-defined componenent to this music
 Finally, the project will be packaged into the form of a Mobile (Android) App - or alternatively a Flask-based web app (in case of limited time constraints).
