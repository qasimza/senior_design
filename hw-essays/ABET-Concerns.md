# ABET Concerns

## Economic and Legal 

So far, the plan has been to utilize free-to-use APIs, programming languages and tools. A part of this project will utilize Spotifyâ€™s APIs as well as Google Sign-In which are both free to use.  However, depending on requirements that may arise in the future, premium versions of these tools may be purchased to accomplish future tasks in the project, if needed. Furthermore, commercialization of the project may require additional purchase of licenses to continue using certain APIs. These funds will be supplied personally. 

## Technical Knowledge and Time

While I have some experience with the technologies related to the development of this algorithm, one of the biggest constraints for this project is that I have minimal experience with Android development. The project requires the creation of an Android application from scratch. This means that to accomplish all the desired tasks in this project. This means that I may need to spend additional time learning the different technologies associated with Android development and might have additional constraints on what can be accomplished under the limited amount of time. 

## Diversity and Cultural

Music is heavily influenced and differs by cultural attributes, such as language, and instrumentation. Many musical genres are unique to some geographical region or to an ethnic, religious, or linguistic group. Given the extensive nature of music, its it is not feasible to create a solution that is exhaustive and applicable to all kinds of music. The project, therefore, will most likely be constrained to Western music (in English) with a plan to develop support for one additional language (Spanish) if time permitting.
