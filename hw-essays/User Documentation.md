# Description

This code imports several Python libraries including NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, XGBoost, and Yellowbrick. It then reads in a CSV file called tracks.csv and drops any rows with missing values.

Next, the code does some data preprocessing by dropping the columns id and id_artists from the tracks DataFrame, extracting the year from the release_date column and adding a new year column, dropping the release_date column, and concatenating the name, artists, and year columns into a new text column. It then applies the TF-IDF vectorizer to the text column to create a feature matrix X.

The code then uses the Yellowbrick library to create a feature correlation matrix for a subset of the features in the tracks DataFrame. It then sorts the tracks DataFrame by popularity and drops any duplicate tracks based on their name.

Next, the code trains an XGBoost regression model on the tracks DataFrame using the duration_ms, explicit, acousticness, danceability, energy, key, loudness, instrumentalness, liveness, speechiness, tempo, and valence features to predict the popularity target variable. It saves the trained model to a pickle file called model.pkl.

Finally, the code reads in another CSV file called artists.csv, drops the id column, drops any rows with missing values, sorts the DataFrame by popularity, and fits a CountVectorizer to the genres column. It then defines a function to compute the cosine similarities between a given song and all other songs in the dataset using the genres as the similarity metric.
